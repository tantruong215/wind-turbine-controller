# Development Notes â€“ Wind Turbine Controller

**June 6, 2025**  
Initial repo push. Defined test conditions for PM generator. Simulated overvoltage dump-load circuit in LTspice. Designed blade-pitch logging format.

To Do Next:
- Implement Arduino datalogging via PySerial
- Build buck protection circuit for >32V
- Deploy test rotor on tripod with voltage sensors
