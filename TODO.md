# TODO – Wind Turbine Controller

- [ ] Model turbine behavior at various wind speeds (3–12 m/s)
- [ ] Build Arduino circuit to log voltage, current, RPM
- [ ] Design dump-load overvoltage protection circuit
- [ ] Automate data logging via PySerial to laptop
- [ ] Run test trials and track power curve vs. datasheet
- [ ] Optimize blade pitch for improved energy capture
